INTRODUCTION : 
GPS testing was a large part of the summer for us. We wanted to be able to find error
that was native to the GPS. The GPS is a frustrating piece of equipment and took a 
very long time to figure out so this is what we have.


FILE DESCRIPTION : 

plotGPS.m : This plots the GPS data from a given CSV file. This will only plot the 
	data for when the GPS is in RTK lock and will disregard the rest. Even then 
	some of the data is not good and must be ignored. See code comments for more.

find_error_distribution.m : This will find a distribution of a certain variable 
	blocked out in chunks of a given iteration size






This is in progress and is to be worked on the first few weeks of September
